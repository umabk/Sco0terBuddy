# Sco0terBuddy

Sco0terBuddy is a fun attachment to your scooter than experiences the ride with you. 
It will sing happily when you ride downhill, whine when you go downhill and get angry if you leave it idle for a while.
Uses RGB LEDs, piezzo buzzers and an accelerometer.
It will also post live updates to Twitter (see these on Twitter @Sco0terBuddy) using the Wifi shield on its Feather M0 
microcontroller.
